      <h3>About Early Life</h3>
      <div class="page">
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907
          in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what
          was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of
          seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and
          her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle
          Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the
          agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the
          Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915. After being sent to the village school
          in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand
          Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.In 1923, he joined the National College
          in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to
          Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students
          to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian
          government. Singh's photo during his first arrest Police became
          concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May
          1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had
          taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of
          Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu
          and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsarand also contributed to
          low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that
          excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the
          Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the
          Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.He often used pseudonyms,
          including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.
